    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This traditional Puerto Rican recipe for Pastelitos de Carne (Beef Turnovers) is a flavor-packed recipe that will leave you wanting more! The recipe in particular involves beef and cheese, allowing for a delightful mix of flavors in the Pastelitos.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>85% Lean Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Queso de Freir (Fried Cheese)</li>
        <li>Empanada Discs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the beef however you'd like, though I recommend simply using Adobo seasoning mix and topping it off by squeezing a lime over the beef. Once it is seasoned, you may begin cooking it.</li>
        <li>Remove the wrapping of the Queso de Freir, and cut thin slices. Fry them on a separate pan.</li>
        <li>Take out however many empanada discs you want, and fill each of them with the fried cheese and ground beef. Fold the disc in half, wet the edges of the fold and hold a fork to its ends on both sides of the disc, in order to create that distinct Pastelito appearance.</li>
        <li>Put the pastelitos into a pan and fry them, being sure to flip to both sides.</li>
    </ol>
